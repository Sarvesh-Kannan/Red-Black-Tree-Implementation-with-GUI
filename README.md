## Overview

This application allows you to visualize operations on a Red-Black Tree, including insertion and deletion of nodes. It provides both textual and graphical representations of the tree.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add nodes to the Red-Black Tree.
- **Deletion**: Remove nodes from the Red-Black Tree.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of the tree using Tkinter canvas.
- **Traversal**: Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal options.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included in Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/red-black-tree.git
   cd red-black-tree
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   # No additional dependencies required beyond Python and Tkinter
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python redblacktree.py
   ```

2. Interface:
   - Enter a number in the Entry box and click **Insert** to add a node to the tree.
   - Enter a number in the Entry box and click **Delete** to remove a node from the tree.
   - Click **Print Tree** to display the current state of the tree in the console.

3. Viewing the tree:
   - The graphical representation of the tree will be displayed on the Tkinter canvas.
   - Nodes are represented as circles with values, colored according to their Red-Black Tree properties.
